OOPS--

3 Priciples of OOPS
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
    - Method Overloading/Compile time
    - Method Overriding/ Run time

concepts

Abstraction -Model


Inheritance

 - Single Level
 - Multi Level
 - Hierarchical Level
==================================
No Hybrid
No Multiple inheritance


Benefit

1. Code Reusabilty
2. Creating more classes from existing class

===================================================

Poly means Many
Morphism Forms

If one or more method is having same name but
different list of parameter, type of parameter, order of parameter
then method is said to be overloaded

Based on the argument the method will be called
its compile time PL



Overriding

If a sub class method has same method signature with its super class
then method is said be overriden

Reimplementation of the same method
